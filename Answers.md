Question1

a) Complete these user stories:
■Ass a vanilla gi I 
want to understand the unique features of GiggleGit.
■ As a team lead onboarding an experienced GiggleGit user, I want o have 
comprehensive documentation and training materials available so that I can 
efficiently train my team on using GiggleGit.

b) Create a third user story, one task for this user story, and two 
associated tickets.
Task:
■Create an interactive tutorial for new users.

User Story:
■As a new GiggleGit user, I want to see a step-by-step tutorial upon 
first login.

Tickets:
■Design Tutorial flow: Detail the steps and key features to be covered in 
the interactive tutorial, ensuring it covers essential functions and 
unique features of GiggleGit.

c)This is not a user story. Why not? What is it?
This is not a user story because it lacks a specific persona and context 
about the problem being solved or the value being provided. It is more of 
a requirement or feature request. The correct version should be "As a user 
who frequently switches devices, I want to be able to authenticate on a 
new machine easily so that I can continue my work without interruption."

List one goal and one non-goal:

Goal:
Ensure that SnickerSync integrates seamlessly with GiggleGit and enhances
